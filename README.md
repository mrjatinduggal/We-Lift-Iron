Gym Landing Page (Responsive). !!--HELP--!!
There is an issue in this web page which i am unable to solve,
3rd Dialog box's width (Gender) is perfectly aligned when seen this page on a laptop even by changing width of webpage to check responsiveness everything is fine, but that box's width is different when this webpage is opened in a mobile.
